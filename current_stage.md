- **App Home Interface**: Dynamic home tab with role-based views and admin controls
- **Interactive Actions**: Button-based interactions for statistics and thread summarization
- **User Management**: Permission-based access control and user information caching

## Phase 2 Features:
- **Hybrid Retrieval**: Combines keyword matching (BM25-style) with semantic vector search
- **Cohere Reranking**: Uses Cohere's rerank model for better relevance scoring
- **Thread Context Expansion**: Automatically includes neighboring messages for better context
- **Enhanced Citations**: Proper Slack permalinks and source attribution
- **Advanced Filtering**: Channel-specific and time-window filtering
- **Smart Query Parsing**: Understands commands like `/ask #general last 7d What was decided?`
- **Channel Access Management**: Help page and clear instructions for bot invitation
- **Improved Error Handling**: Better user feedback and troubleshooting guidance

## Phase 3 Features:
- **App Home Interface**: Dynamic home tab with different views for users and admins
- **Role-Based Access**: Automatic detection of workspace admins and installers
- **Interactive Components**: Button-based actions for statistics and system management
- **Thread Summarization**: AI-powered summarization of long conversation threads
- **User Information Caching**: Efficient caching of user data and permissions
- **Admin Dashboard**: Real-time statistics and system health monitoring
- **Enhanced UX Patterns**: Ephemeral responses and contextual help
- **Permission Management**: Secure admin controls with proper access validation

## Ready for Testing:
Phase 3 is complete and ready for comprehensive testing:
1. **App Home Interface**: Test user and admin views
2. **Interactive Actions**: Test button interactions and statistics
3. **Thread Summarization**: Test AI-powered thread summaries
4. **Permission Management**: Verify admin access controls
5. **User Experience**: Test ephemeral responses and UX patterns
6. **Admin Dashboard**: Verify statistics and system monitoring

## Current Testing Status:
âœ… **OAuth Configuration**: Working correctly
âœ… **ngrok Setup**: Running and configured
âœ… **Slack App Configuration**: All endpoints configured
âœ… **Bot Installation**: Active in workspace
âœ… **Phase 1 Implementation**: Complete and tested
âœ… **Phase 2 Implementation**: Complete with enhanced RAG pipeline
âœ… **Phase 3 Implementation**: Complete with App Home and interactive features

## Phase 3 Status: âœ… COMPLETE
All Slack UX and interactive components are implemented!

## Phase 4: Bug Fixes & Improvements (Current)
### Issues Identified and Fixed:
âœ… **Cohere Rerank API Error**: Fixed parameter mismatch (top_k vs top_n)
âœ… **Source Citations**: Enhanced source message display with better formatting
âœ… **Message Indexing**: Improved message filtering and processing logic
âœ… **RAG Context**: Fixed RAG pipeline to properly use indexed messages as context
âœ… **Debugging Tools**: Added comprehensive debugging endpoints and logging

### Current Issues Being Addressed:
ðŸ”„ **Channel Access**: Bot needs to be invited to channels to read messages
ðŸ”„ **Message Filtering**: Fine-tuning message filtering logic for better indexing
ðŸ”„ **User Feedback**: Improving indexing feedback and setup instructions

### Debug Endpoints Added:
- `/debug/{team_id}` - Check team-specific data and indexed messages
- `/debug/{team_id}/reindex` - Manually trigger reindexing
- Enhanced logging throughout the RAG pipeline

## Next Phase: Phase 4 - Operations & Evaluation
Ready to move to Phase 4 which includes:
- Monitoring and metrics implementation
- Evaluation framework setup
- Admin tools and data management
- Performance optimization

## Architecture Progress:
Following the 3-service architecture:
- âœ… Service A: Ingestion & Sync Worker (Phase 1 - COMPLETE)
- âœ… Service B: Query API (Phase 2 - COMPLETE)
- âœ… Service C: Slack Frontend (Phase 3 - COMPLETE)

## Development Approach:
- MVP-first implementation
- Slack-native integration patterns
- Multi-tenant by design (team_id isolation)
- Thread-aware processing with context expansion
- Real-time event handling
- Enhanced RAG with hybrid retrieval and reranking
- Interactive UX with App Home and message actions
- Role-based access control and admin management
