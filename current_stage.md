## Phase 3 Status: ✅ COMPLETE
All Slack UX and interactive components are implemented!

## Phase 4: Operations & Evaluation (COMPLETED)
### ✅ Monitoring & Metrics Implementation:
✅ **Prometheus Metrics**: Complete metrics collection with business and technical metrics
✅ **Structured Logging**: Comprehensive logging with structured data and audit trails
✅ **Performance Monitoring**: Query processing time, API costs, and system health tracking
✅ **System Health Checks**: Detailed health monitoring for installations and system status

- `/evaluate/{team_id}/report` - Get evaluation reports
- `/admin/*` - Complete admin API for data management
- Enhanced `/health` endpoint with system metrics

## Phase 4 Status: ✅ COMPLETE
All operations, evaluation, and admin tools are implemented!

## Next Priority: Phase 5 - Production Database Integration

### Current Limitation:
⚠️ **In-Memory Storage**: System currently uses Python dictionaries for storage, which is not production-ready:
- `INSTALLATIONS = {}` - Team installation data
- `MESSAGE_VECTORS = defaultdict(list)` - Message vectors and metadata
- `VECTOR_CACHE = {}` - Embedding cache
- `USER_CACHE = {}` - User information cache

### Phase 5 Goals:
🔄 **LanceDB Integration**: Replace in-memory vector storage with LanceDB
🔄 **PostgreSQL Integration**: Replace in-memory metadata with PostgreSQL
🔄 **Data Persistence**: Ensure data survives application restarts
🔄 **Production Scalability**: Handle millions of messages per team
🔄 **Migration Tools**: Create migration scripts from in-memory to persistent storage

### Benefits of LanceDB:
- **Local Vector Storage**: No external API dependencies
- **High Performance**: Optimized for vector similarity search
- **Multi-tenant Support**: Namespace-based isolation
- **Cost Effective**: No per-query costs like Pinecone/Weaviate
- **Persistent Storage**: Data survives application restarts

## Architecture Progress:
Following the 3-service architecture:
- ✅ Service A: Ingestion & Sync Worker (Phase 1 - COMPLETE)
- ✅ Service B: Query API (Phase 2 - COMPLETE)
- ✅ Service C: Slack Frontend (Phase 3 - COMPLETE)
- 🔄 **Phase 5**: Production Database Integration (NEXT PRIORITY)

## Development Approach:
- MVP-first implementation
- Slack-native integration patterns
- Multi-tenant by design (team_id isolation)
- Thread-aware processing with context expansion
- Real-time event handling
- Enhanced RAG with hybrid retrieval and reranking
- Interactive UX with App Home and message actions
- Role-based access control and admin management
